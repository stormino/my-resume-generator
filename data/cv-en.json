    "summary": "I've been working professionally in software development for about 20 years, but it has been a lifelong passion. I don't consider myself just a programmer, as I have transitioned from a passion for cybersecurity during my school days to a strong interest in the devops culture and the infrastructural/architectural side of systems. I'm rigorous and attentive to the technical aspects, but I have the necessary sensitivity and experience to understand what is important to develop for the company I work for. I'm driven by curiosity, which makes me a person with interests in all areas, something I consider fundamental to being a better professional.",
